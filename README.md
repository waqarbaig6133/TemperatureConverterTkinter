Simple Temperature Converter made with the tkinter library. The main features of this GUI include changing colors with respect to the temperature of water: at boiling point (100C, 212F, 373.15K), it will turn red. You can choose the unit in either side, and two of the same units will just swap places. So Celcius and fahrenheit to celcius celcius will just do fahrenheit celcius instead. No value will automatically class it as 0.
